# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
- Because it's rich in features, for example fetch(key_name) which gives you the key value if it exists. fetch(key_name, default_value) which gives you a default value if key isn't inserted.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
- Because the chain of ancestors always follows a single path, where each module or class can only appear once. A solution can be to use a module instead.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
