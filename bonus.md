# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?

  Hash.fetch is useful because it looks for a key value and assigns it a default if it is not found. This allows for more flexibility in programs in use with options hash

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

  A class/object can only inherit from one parent class. This can make design and organization a bit more difficult when thinking about the inheritance chain and how to structure models. A solution is including/using modules?

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

  Classes are initialized with an options hash because it does not require the programmer to remember the order of all of the arguments being passed in, also allows for default value setting with hash#fetch

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

  The private keyword allows the programmer to 'mask' certain behaviors or states of a program that should not be interacted with (static internal behaviors).

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?

  Decreases coupling and dependencies and allowing for scaling and a more dynamic nature to programs.
